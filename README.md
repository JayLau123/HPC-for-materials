High performance computing for materials simulation

## What is high performance computing?

Actually, the high performance computing also known as supercomputing, it is about solving big, complex, computational-expensive problems as efficiently as possible.

The truth is, there are many scientific problems requires increasingly more efficient algorithm and computational resources.  We can use supercomputers to do many important stuff. Stuff like simulating the weather model, thousands of millions of atoms in condensed matter, solid state materials, macro bio-molecules system such as protein, cosmology, especially for some incredibly complex phenomena. and of course the active artificial intelligence field: large language model.

Many scientists believe we won't gain any insight into these problems without some combination of mathematical models, algorithm, more high quality data.

The main question we should be interested in is, given a computational problem and an affordable machine, how can we compute at the absolute limits of scale and speed.

We will encounter many limits throughout the field of HPC, one of the interesting ones, come from physics, like the limit based on the speed of light, or the amount of energy, power or heat transfer in the materials inside the system. 

That's why I'm also interested in quantum computing system, which represents the ultimate state of physical computation. I believe it's a promising solution to break the limits of conventional computing systems.



## Scalable parallel computing

“Scale” really refers to two things: efficient as the problem size grows, and efficient as the system size grows (measured in numbers of cores or compute nodes).

## DFT, HPC, machine learning

#### DFT: physics-informed materials research, based on equation and physical meaning.

Schordinger's equation

Kohn-Sham equation


#### machine learning: data-driven materials research, based on big data and statistics.

#### HPC: GPU acceleration for real ab initio calculation


## HPC: pave the way to quantum computing
